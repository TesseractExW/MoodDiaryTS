            <p>
                MoodDiary is a web-based application designed to help users track and understand their emotions over time. By logging your current mood daily, MoodDiary provides insightful analysis of your emotional patterns and trends. Our goal is to empower users with self-awareness and encourage mental well-being through simple, intuitive tools.
                This project was developed as part of a Computer Science group assignment, combining web development, data visualization, and basic sentiment analysis techniques to create a user-friendly platform for emotional tracking.
